# Generating Noisy Speech Data using Deep Learning methods

A repository comprising of code for generation of noisy speech data from clean data using deep learning methods

The code makes use of the [official SinGAN implementaion](https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN) to generate noisy spectrograms of audio data.
We make use of the Paint2Image module of SinGAN.
