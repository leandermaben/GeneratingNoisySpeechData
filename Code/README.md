## How the files are structured:

- Use feat_extract.py to generate the spectrogram image that will be fed to singan for training.
- Use reading_spec_gen_by_sgan.ipynb to reconstuct the audio files from the output of singan.

**Note: Take a look at the "spec gen by singan" folder to get a better idea.**
