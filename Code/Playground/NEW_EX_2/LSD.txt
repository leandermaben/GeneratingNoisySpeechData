LSD between ground truth noise and output at:

start_scale=1: 18.842
start_scale=2: 18.732
start_scale=3: 17.182
start_scale=4: 14.330
start_scale=5: 10.067

Observation: LSD decreases, i.e. the power spec of the output starts increasingly resemble the ground truth noise. Maybe because ground_truth spec and paint resemble quite much. The noise characteristics are not captured by SinGAN, it just reproduces the paint image.

LSD between paint and out put at:

start_scale=1: 15.278
start_scale=2: 13.077
start_scale=3: 10.320
start_scale=4: 6.874
start_scale=5: 3.016

Observation: LSD decreases, output and paint resembles.
