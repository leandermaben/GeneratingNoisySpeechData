LSD between ground truth noise and output at:

start_scale=1: 15.787
start_scale=2: 9.950
start_scale=3: 8.685
start_scale=4: 8.646
start_scale=5: 8.460

Observation: LSD decreases, i.e. the power spec of the output starts increasingly resemble the ground truth noise. Maybe because ground_truth spec and paint resemble quite much. The noise characteristics are not captured by SinGAN, it just reproduces the paint image.

LSD between paint and out put at:

start_scale=1: 14.353
start_scale=2: 7.900
start_scale=3: 5.602
start_scale=4: 3.677
start_scale=5: 2.484

Observation: LSD decreases, output and paint resembles.
