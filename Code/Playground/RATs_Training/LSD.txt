LSD between ground truth noise and output at:

start_scale=1: 15.103
start_scale=2: 15.345
start_scale=3: 16.991
start_scale=4: 17.489
start_scale=5: 17.787

Observation: LSD increases with scale, which is obvious since the output spectrogram begins to look a lot like the paint spec, and not the ground_truth noise spec.

LSD between paint and out put at:

start_scale=1: 11.098
start_scale=2: 9.267
start_scale=3: 5.313
start_scale=4: 2.970
start_scale=5: 2.573

Observation: LSD decreases, output and paint resembles but SinGAN fails to capture the characteristics of the ground_truth noise.
