LSD between ground truth noise and output at:

start_scale=1: 14.119
start_scale=2: 14.118
start_scale=3: 15.561
start_scale=4: 16.172
start_scale=5: 17.206
start_scale=6: 17.382
start_scale=7: 17.743

Observation: LSD increases with scale, which is obvious since the output spectrogram begins to look a lot like the paint spec, and not the ground_truth noise spec.

LSD between paint and out put at:

start_scale=1: 13.078
start_scale=2: 13.361
start_scale=3: 10.720
start_scale=4: 8.712
start_scale=5: 7.942
start_scale=6: 7.192
start_scale=7: 6.329

Observation: LSD decreases, output and paint resembles but SinGAN fails to capture the characteristics of the ground_truth noise.
